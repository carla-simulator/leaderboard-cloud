# AWS Interface

Moving on from Kubernetes, it is now time to start using the AWS interface to create all of the remaining elements that are part of the backend. This section will start with the permissions needed to run this and move onto the specific elements to be created, which can be divided in two categories, storage services, used to save all the relevant information about the submissions, and deployment services, which are responisble for running the submission.

Note that all of the AWS services have been created in the `us-west-2` region.
